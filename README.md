# Pandoc

Pandoc in pip and conda. Contents:

* [conda-forge/**pandoc**](https://github.com/conda-forge/pandoc-feedstock) feedstock backup (I'm not a maintainer though),
* pypi stub is not needed as there is already a useless [**pandoc**](https://pypi.org/project/pandoc/) package on pypi,
* pypi **py-pandoc** package (+ workaround for pip on Anaconda being not aware of pure conda packages), 
* [conda-forge/**py-pandoc**](https://github.com/conda-forge/py-pandoc-feedstock) feedstock backup.
