# Pandoc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kiwi0fruit/py-pandoc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kiwi0fruit/py-pandoc)

[Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) in pip and conda. Contents:

* [conda-forge/**pandoc**](https://github.com/conda-forge/pandoc-feedstock) feedstock backup,
* pypi stub that prevents name clash with conda-forge/pandoc is not needed as there is already a useless [**pandoc**](https://pypi.org/project/pandoc/) package on pypi (better use [panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute) instead),
* pypi [**py-pandoc**](https://pypi.org/project/py-pandoc/) package (+ workaround for pip on Anaconda being not aware of pure conda packages), 
* [conda-forge/**py-pandoc**](https://github.com/conda-forge/py-pandoc-feedstock) feedstock backup.
